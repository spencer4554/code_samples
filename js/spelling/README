__DESCRIPTION__

Sample code written using Node.js and Express for the following problem:

1) Build a RESTful spell-checking service

This service should have a resource that accepts a word and returns a response indicating whether the word is spelled correctly, with suggestions if it’s mis-spelled.  You’re welcome to use existing spell-check libraries as you see fit.


__REQUIREMENTS__

Unix compatible environment
Python
pip
Virtualenv (although it will attempt to install it if not present)
   

__INSTALLATION__

The install script attempts to create a python virtualenv, then to install nodeenv (and Node.js) in this python virtualenv and then to install the necessary node packages.  

To install run:

./install.sh

This should work on linux or mac os X.  It will produce a single warning:

npm WARN package.json supertest@0.0.1 No repository field.

This is expected and is an issue with the Supertest package. 


__RUNNING_TESTS__

To run the unit tests:

./run_tests.sh


__RUNNING_SERVER__

To run the server:

./run.sh

then in a local web browser you should be able to:

http://localhost:3000/spellcheck/word

and it will return a response in the following format:

{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "suggestions": [],
    "correct": true
  }
}
